# emcee Jupyter notebooks

Matthew Kenworthy

A set of emcee model examples so that you can hit the ground running

They are self contained examples, download, install `emcee` and run them. They're
based on the `emcee` quickstart examples and on other bits of Notebooks from 
collaborators that have useful shortcuts for using and modifying the original
tutorials.
